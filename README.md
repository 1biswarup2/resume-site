# Projects
1• Assessment Of Drug on Protein Molecule for  Disease Prevention
 A prediction system that can tell if a newly discovered drug is able to prevent a certain disease or not.

– The main objective of the project was to help researchers to find out if their newly invented drug molecule is capable of preventing a certain disease or not.
– Here I have got an accuracy of approximately 86 percent.

– Technology Used: Python , pandas , numpy, rdkit, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn.

2• Text summarization using NLP

Here I have shown various techniques to get extractive summary of any text provided in a given number of lines

– I have shown here three techniques of summarization: a. Page-rank score based, b. Maximum Marginal Relevance based and c. Clustering based
– Technology and libraries Used: python,nltk,sklearn,networkx,numpy,scipy,math,random.

3•  A portfolio website

This site is built by me from scratch to showcase my skills and let people know me.

– Here I have given my educational background, professional experience and skills etc in details in different pages

– Technology and libraries Used : html,css,bootstrap,python,django
